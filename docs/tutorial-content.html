    <h1 id="prepare-module-content">Prepare module content</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we will add content to the files created by <code>addmod</code>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-page">Introduction page</h2>
<p>Open <code>intro.md</code>. It should contain the following text:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: "1.1. Introduction"
---</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, Simple Canvas provided a default title with a prefix, <code>1.1.</code>. This communicates that the introduction is the first item in the first content module. Let’s edit our title and add some content as follows:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: "1.1. Welcome to \"SC\"!"
---

# Welcome to SC 101!

This week we will learn about Simple Canvas.</code></pre>
<p>Recall that we used <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">Pandoc’s Markdown syntax</a> when we drafted the default quiz description in <a href="tutorial-course.html">Part 2 of the tutorial</a>. We must also follow this Markdown syntax to format course pages and <a href="#discussion-board">discussion board prompts</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Notice that we have placed the title text inside quotation marks and that we have escaped quotation marks that are part of the text (<code>\"SC\"</code>). Enclose all titles in quotation marks to ensure that Simple Canvas parses the text correctly.</p>
</div>
<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<h2 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h2>
<p>Open <code>quiz.yaml</code>. It should contain this <a href="https://yaml.org">YAML</a>-formatted text:</p>
<pre><code>title: "1.2. Quiz"
description: null
times:
  unlock_at: "2025-05-01T17:00:00Z"
  due_at: "2025-05-01T18:00:00Z"
  lock_at: "2025-05-01T18:30:00Z"
questions:
  - question: "What is ..."
    correct:
      - "Answer 1"
      - "Answer 2"
    incorrect:
      - "Answer 3"
      - "Answer 4"
  - question: "Write about ..."</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the title, <code>1.2. Quiz</code>, indicates that this is the second item in the first content module.</p>
<h3 id="quiz-settings">Quiz settings</h3>
<p>Recall that we set default unlock times, deadlines, and lock times for quizzes when we created our course with <code>newcourse</code> in the <a href="tutorial-course.html">second tutorial</a>. Notice that Simple Canvas combined those times with our quiz date, <code>2025-05-01</code>, to create date-time strings that Canvas can parse.</p>
<p>Additionally notice that the quiz <code>description</code> is set to <code>null</code>. Simple Canvas will, therefore, use the default quiz description in <code>SC101/_conf/quiz-desc.md</code> when we upload the quiz to Canvas in the <a href="tutorial-upload.html">next tutorial</a>. Refer to the <a href="howto-quiz.html">guide to quizzes</a> to learn how to customize the quiz description for an individual quiz.</p>
<h3 id="quiz-questions">Quiz questions</h3>
<p>The default quiz template contains two questions. Note the structure of each question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each question follows the <code>questions:</code> line.</li>
<li>Each question begins with <code>- question:</code>, which is offset by two spaces.</li>
<li>Question text is enclosed in quotation marks and follows <code>- question:</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple Canvas can handle three kinds of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple Canvas treats questions without answers as an <em>essay question</em>. The second question in the template is an essay question.</li>
<li>Simple Canvas treats questions with only one correct answer as a <em>multiple choice question</em>. The template above does not contain a multiple choice question.</li>
<li>Simple Canvas treats questions with more than one correct answer as a <em>multiple answers question</em>. The first question in the template is a multiple answers question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that answers are divided into two groups: <code>correct</code> and <code>incorrect</code>. Both of these words are preceded by four spaces to align with the word <code>question</code> and both are followed by a colon <code>:</code>.</p>
<p>Answers follow either <code>correct</code> or <code>incorrect</code>. Each answer text is preceded by six spaces, a hyphen <code>-</code>, and another space. Each answer is enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-choice-question">Multiple choice question</h3>
<p>Let’s add some questions to our quiz. We will first add a multiple choice question. Remove the text beneath <code>questions:</code> and add the following:</p>
<pre><code>questions:
  - question: "Which command creates a module?"
    correct:
      - "addmod"
    incorrect:
      - "newcourse"
      - "upmod"</code></pre>
<p>This question has only one correct answer. Simple Canvas will treat this question as a multiple choice question.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-answers-question">Multiple answers question</h3>
<p>Let’s add a multiple answers question. Add this at the bottom of <code>quiz.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  - question: "What are the default module items?"
    correct:
      - "pages"
      - "quizzes"
      - "discussions"
    incorrect:
      - "assignments"</code></pre>
<p>This question has three correct answers. Simple Canvas will treat this question as a multiple answers question.</p>
<h3 id="essay-question">Essay question</h3>
<p>Let’s add a final essay question. Add this at the bottom of <code>quiz.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  - question: "What do you like about Simple Canvas?"</code></pre>
<p>This question does not have answers listed. Simple Canvas will treat this question as an essay question.</p>
<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-boards">Discussion boards</h2>
<p>Finally, let’s update our discussion board. Open <code>disc.md</code>. It should contain this text:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: "1.3. Discussion"
---</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the title indicates that this is the third item in the first content module.</p>
<p>As with the <a href="#introduction-page">introduction page</a>, we can add Markdown-formatted text to this file. Add this text below the three hyphens <code>---</code>:</p>
<pre><code># Overview
